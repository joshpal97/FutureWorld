- jump doesnt let you jump over obstacles
- visual representation when the gun shoots (laser)
- no strafing animation yet (a and d keys)
- camera wierd than its doesnt go up and down (firing above and below)
- maybe an aim then fire type control (right click to aim and show cross hair)
- make the mouse cursor disappear
- use a mesh collider for Katya so jumping actually works

- accuracy vs damage for single gun vs dual guns (or some other trade-off)
- ammo
- inform player they can draw two guns
- inform player that they can sprint
- healthbar
